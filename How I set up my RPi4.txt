# Baking my Pi 4

## Note
> This is the first time I ever used a Raspberry Pi at all and I wanted to create a Cyber Security Project that would 
be able to look for potential vulnerabilities in my Wifi, my girlfriend's wifi, and wherever I am able to use this tool.
> I also wanted to demonstrate my skills, competence and interest in learning more about the field as I want to break
into the industry after graduating college.

## Getting started
1. I bought a Raspberry Pi 4 and a 128 gb Micro SD card for the holidays from Microcenter and Amazon.
2. I also had a usb-c cable laying around that I connected to an old 5 volt power adapter that was used for an old phone.
3. I then downloaded the Raspberry Pi Imager which allowed me to choose the Pi device I was using, choose the Operating System,
and choose the storage device that was going to contain the files to set up my Pi.
4. A problem that I ran into was figuring out how to use the Pi headless, meaning without a monitor.
5. In the settings of the imager, there was a Secure Shell option that I turned on which in turn allowed me to communicate to the Pi
with my original desktop.
6. In powershell, I connected to the Pi with ssh and logged my details.
7. I then did the command "sudo apt update" to update the local database of available packages.
8. Then I did "sudo apt-get -uy dist-upgrade" to actually upgrade the installed packages to their latest versions.
9. I let powershell update everything and in the meantime I downloaded the Nessus file needed for the Pi
10. I then did "sudo reboot" just to make sure everything was good to go.
11. After this, I downloaded the Nessus Raspberry Pi image to install to the raspberry pi
12. To do this i used secure copy to copy the file over in powershell.
13. After copying the file to the rpi, I ssh back into the system I ran the two commands that was told to use on Nessus's website when setting it up on a rpi
14. When running the command "dpkg -i Nessus-10.0.0-raspberrypios_armhf.deb" we need to do sudo to actually be able to run the command. We also need to make sure the command is correct as the command on the website is outdated so I had to change the command to the updated file name "dpkg -i Nessus-10.6.4-raspberrypios_armhf.deb"
15. Then we are told to be able to use 'nessusd' daemon we need to use the following command "/bin/systemctl start nessusd.service" and I needed to input my password as authentication was required to start 'nessusd.service'
16. I realized that I needed to actually see what's going on in my rpi but i didnt have a cable to actually connect it to my monitor so ran the command "sudo apt install tightvncserver" in order to use VNC viewer to remotely see whats actually going on in my rpi
17. I then downloaded and ran VNC viewer and created a new connection for my rpi
18. I am now able to remotely access my rpi and the vulnerability scanner was successfully installed
